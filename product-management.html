										<h3>Product Strategy</h3>
										<p>As an innovative product strategist on numerous projects, I have demonstrated strong project management skills, a user-centered approach, innovative thinking, business acumen, and excellent communication and collaboration skills. I have led the development and implementation of custom CMS and learning platforms, managed content creation and publishing pipelines, and collected feedback to improve product direction and user experience.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Explored emerging technologies like blockchain, AI, AR, and VR to create solutions for practical on-the-job use cases and engaging virtual learning experiences</li>
											<li>Worked closely with various teams to ensure products met the needs of the business and drove value</li>
											<li>Coordinated and connected various teams across the organization to build unique products</li>
											<li>Managed migrations to new platforms and tools along with the upskilling of employees</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Metrics and Analytics</h3>
										<p>I have led multiple initiatives related to building online web and analytics platforms. My efforts included developing an easy-to-use search portal, integrating interactive flow charts and rich media content, and experimenting with AI-assisted search functions in use for thousands of employees on a daily basis. I have experience with peer-to-peer social learning and support solutions for crowdsourced problem-solving, suggesting useful content based on engagement analytics, and tracking training progress using learning analytics. Engagement and adoption of online tools improved streamlining the content pipeline and creating an experience that feels more intuitive to users and supports the overall goals of the company.</p>
										<p>Leveraging purpose-built analytics platforms, my team of data analysts have been able to provide real-time research to catch issues before they become widespread and our detailed alerts have reduced call handle time and improved issue troubleshooting. Custom reporting dashboards were designed to promote the value of the work performed by the team, keep stakeholders informed on the most impactful issues in current technology news, and drive numerous continuous improvement initiatives. The dashboards are regularly updated with the latest data and insights, allowing for real-time tracking and analysis of key metrics and trends.</p>
