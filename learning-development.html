										<h3>Strategy and Business Growth</h3>
										<p>I am a skilled professional with a focus on improving learning experiences. I have launched new lines of business, hired and trained large teams, and created support structures for successful new initiatives. My accomplishments include leading the implementation of a same-day device replacement service for phones, developing local partnerships and training programs, and creating a strong national footprint for future ventures and partnerships.
